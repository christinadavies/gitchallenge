Describe yourself in two to three sentences.
I'm an English teacher who loves to travel and collect new experiences. I'm currently working at a private English school in Seoul, South Korea, and continuing to be amazed by this wonderful country that I've called home for 3 years now.

As I wrap up my last year of teaching, I'm looking forward to acquiring new skills in Web Development and pursue a career which will nurture my love for technology and design.
What's important to you?
Where are you from?
I'm from Salem, Massachusetts, about 30 minutes outside of Boston - also known as the greatest city in the world. As you can see, I'm very proud where I'm from, and I take that with me whenever I travel somewhere new. I studied Journalism in New York City for my undergrad and I spent a semester abroad in Shanghai, China.
What are your favorite hobbies?
Eating and taking pictures of what I eat. (Seriously.) My favorite part of living abroad is being able to try new dishes regularly, and I love sharing the experience of trying some of the stranger cuisines with my friends.
I also love running and riding my bike along the river after work. Lately, I've been filling in my coloring book to help relieve stress.
What's your dream job?
Simply to be a Freelance Web Designer. I love making sure things look right!
What music have you been listening to lately?
I've been going back to the Oldies that my parents made me listen to when I was growing up - Fleetwood Mac, Chicago, Barry Manilow, all Disco hits - yeah, it's a mixed bag!
